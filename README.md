# Weather App

A simple app that gets the current weather for a specified city.

The temperature can be displayed in Fahrenheit or Celsius by toggling a button.

OpenWeather [using the API](https://openweathermap.org/current).

## API Key

I removed the api key for security. Even though I used a free api key I thought it best not to expose it.

You can sign up and get a free api key [here](https://openweathermap.org/price).

Copy your api key into the `index.js` file assigned to the variable `apiKey`.

## Formula

To convert temperatures in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit **multiply by 1.8 (or 9/5) and add 32**.

## Degrees Symbol

Press and hold the ALT key and type 0 1 7 6 on the numeric keypad of your keyboard. Make sure the NumLock is on. **Note**: this worked when I tried it before (I was using Windows) but not now (using Ubuntu).

## Async & Await

Theres an example of using async and await in the `index.js` file.
